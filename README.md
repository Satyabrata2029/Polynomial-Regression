# Polynomial-Regression
A short and simple way to fit a given polynomial dataset using gradient descent algorithm.

This is a simple implementation of polynomial regression from scratch using gradient descent algorithm. Here , we have taken the degree = 2. But one should try to change the degrees and tune the other hyperparameters to get the best polynomial fit.
